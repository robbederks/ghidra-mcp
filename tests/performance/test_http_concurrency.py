"""
Regression test for the HTTP server threading contract.

Background: GhidraMCPPlugin.java used to call `server.setExecutor(null)`, which
serialized ALL HTTP requests through a single thread. Symptom: any slow request
(save_program, batch_analyze_completeness) blocked every subsequent request —
even cheap read-only ones like /mcp/schema.

Measured during diagnosis:
    /mcp/schema baseline:     15-36 ms (avg 19.6 ms)
    /mcp/schema under load:   54,076 ms on the first call  (551x slowdown)

Fix: Executors.newFixedThreadPool(8) with a ThreadFactory that names threads
GhidraMCP-HTTP-1..8. Post-fix measurement:
    /mcp/schema baseline:     4-20 ms (avg 10 ms)
    /mcp/schema under load:   15-25 ms (avg 17 ms)  — 1.7x overhead, not 551x

This test fails if anyone removes the thread pool or sets it back to null.
It runs an actual slow request in the background and measures read-only
endpoint latency during the slow call. Any regression is observable as the
thread pool becoming saturated or disappearing entirely.
